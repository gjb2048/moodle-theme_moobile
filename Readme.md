Introduction
============
The 'Moobile' theme is an adaptation of the core 'MyMobile' theme but with far more available colour schemes and a choice of font.

An interactive slider is used to visually select the colour scheme in the settings.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle version 2012120301.02 release 2.4.1+ (Build: 20130118) and above until the next release.

Installation
============
1. Copy the extracted 'moobile' folder to your 'themes' folder.
2. As an administrator navigate to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and update.
3. Configure the settings as desired.
4. Under 'Site administration' -> 'Appearance' -> 'Themes' -> 'Theme selector' set as the 'Mobile' / 'Tablet' theme as desired.

Licence
=======
The main Moobile functionality is licenced under the GPLv3 licence as published on http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ and
contained within the file COPYING.txt.  Except the fonts and BX Slider as described below:

Fonts
-----
Fonts are licenced under the SIL Open Font Licence 1.1 as published on http://scripts.sil.org/OFL a copy of
which is contained for each font within the 'style/font' directory.

BX Slider
---------
The theme incorporates the use of [http://bxslider.com](http://bxslider.com) which is released under a
[WTFPL licence](http://www.wtfpl.net/) - which I consider compatible with the [GPLv3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
Note: I am not responsible for the wording of the [WTFPL licence](http://www.wtfpl.net/) so recommend that
you take measures as you see fit to obscure it's link and meaning to your students, but I have to
reference it here.

Known issues
============
Moobile was derived from the MyMobile theme and as a consequence has potentially any undiscovered flaws that are
in it.  I have endeavoured to eradicate as many problems as I have been able to discover.  However, it is 
inevitable that flaws still remain.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle and that
you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to
make bespoke customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. 

When reporting an issue please use the details at the bottom.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the
theme's version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version and non-core plugin's also helps.
A screen shot can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.
